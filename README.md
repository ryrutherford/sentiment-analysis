# Sentiment Analysis of IMDB Movie Reviews (Supervised Learning Project)

- I use scikit-learn, nltk, and NumPy to train and test different ML classifiers on 10,000+ sentences reflecting either positive or negative sentiment of a movie
- The goal of this project is to determine which model and what pre-processing (stemming, lemmatization, stop words, minimum frequency) are most effective at predicting positive or negative sentiment from a single sentence
